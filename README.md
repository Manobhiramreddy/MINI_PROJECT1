# Crop Management System with Crop Prediction

## Overview
The **Crop Management System** is a web-based application that helps farmers and agricultural stakeholders make informed decisions about crop selection based on soil properties, weather conditions, and other environmental factors. The system uses **Flask** as the backend framework and integrates **machine learning models** for crop prediction.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration for users.
- **Crop Prediction**: Suggests the best crop based on user inputs such as soil type, temperature, humidity, and rainfall.
- **Soil and Weather Analysis**: Provides insights into soil properties and weather conditions.
- **Dashboard**: Interactive dashboard for users to view and manage agricultural data.
- **Data Visualization**: Graphs and charts representing trends in crop selection.
- **REST API Integration**: Provides API endpoints for fetching real-time data.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Bootstrap)
- **Database**: SQLite / MySQL
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn for predictive analysis
- **APIs**: OpenWeather API for weather data (optional)
